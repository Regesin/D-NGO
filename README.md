One of the most significant Ethereum tokens is known as ERC-20. ERC-20 has emerged as the technical standard; it is used for all smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for token implementation and provides a list of rules that all Ethereum-based tokens must follow.

ERC-20 is similar, in some respects, to bitcoin, Litecoin, and any other cryptocurrency; ERC-20 tokens are blockchain-based assets that have value and can be sent and received. The primary difference is that instead of running on their own blockchain, ERC-20 tokens are issued on the Ethereum network.

* We uses decentralized curation of proposals, and proposals that are approved have to show proof that they’ve taken the actions they outlined in their submission for funding, as well as reporting on the results. 
* Users will be able to track the proposal funding through the blockchain, and see concrete evidence of exactly what results their support achieved.
